# GroundUp
GroundUp is an application that consumes a job market API and display's jobs based on user parameters. Future functionality will include searching for lodging/housing around specified areas based on the job parameters. Users can also filter housing by price and type of housing. Everything from renting out single rooms, all the way up to AirBnB's. 
Web Scrapping may get the job done here.

The goal is GroundUp is to give people a chance who want to get back on their feet. A future release will also include budgeting tips based on specified income. As well as health "hacks" or habits that anyone can follow. 

Eventually GroundUp will include user profiles. Users can bookmark potential jobs and housing ads. This functionality will require a database to store user information.
